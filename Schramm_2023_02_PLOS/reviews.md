Reviewer #1: 1. Language need to be improved.
2. What water quality parameters are restricted to 5-6 parameters?
3. Why not other parameters are considered such as pH, Elec. Cond., Alkalinity, Hardness etc.
4. Discussion need to be extensively improved.
5. Novelty statement is missing.


Reviewer #2: The data presented in the paper entitled “Assessing linkages between watershed nutrient loading and water quality in a subtropical estuary with semiparametric models” is of significant importance and falls under the scope of the journal. This study provides the information on the research conducted on the Lavaca Bay watershed in Texas which applies a semiparametric approach to assess the watershed nutrient loads along with other important aspects. The authors need to incorporate the following changes to improve the quality of the manuscript:
1.The research significance of the current study should be written along with the research gaps.
2.A summary of the previously published research papers should also be added.


3.The equation number should be written distinctively from the equation and should be mentioned prior to its appearance in the text. For examples see Page 9 line 184. Incorporate the same throughout the manuscript.

Response: fixed.

4.The indication (r2) used for the fitness of the model should be corrected. See line 225 and 226.

Response: fixed to pearsons r.


5.Maintain the consistency of the notations/abbreviations throughout the manuscript.
6.The use of informal language should be eliminated from discussion and conclusion section.
7.Reframe the conclusions section while highlighting the findings and implications of the current studies.
8.The aim of the study should be explained and pronounced more in the last paragraph of the introduction section.
9.Discussion section is written poorly in terms of technical information. This section should be extended while providing the significant amount of outputs of the current study and its relativeness to the previous studies.
10.The linguistic and grammatical errors need to be removed. Avoid repetition of “We” “our”. Use appropriate words instead of these.
11.Add relevant and latest citations in the second last paragraph on the discussion section.
12.Equation number used throughout the manuscript should be aligned perfectly.
13.As observed by careful examination, the reference used in the current study are quite old. Add latest (2022 onwards) relevant citations in the the manuscript.
14.What other models can be used to evaluate the current arrangements?
15.Rewrite proper way to cite the previous papers. For example “It isn’t obvious why the TP estimate in [43] is notably lower. Given that none of the studies identify substantially sized trends in TP, it is possible that the period used in [43] was drier on average than the other studies. The SPARROW models used in [44] and [46] utilize a version of LOADEST in the underlying load estimation procedure, so a difference due to methodology alone is unlikely on page 15”.
16.Also, I am looking forward to see more future recommendations from the authors point of view while discussing about the findings of the study.
